# Memory Graph Architecture

> **Technical documentation for developers and architects**

This document provides the technical rationale and implementation details behind AgentDock's decision to use a hybrid SQL + in-memory graph approach instead of a dedicated graph database.

## Executive Summary

AgentDock implements a hybrid approach to memory connections, combining relational database persistence with in-memory graph operations. This architecture provides graph-like functionality while maintaining the operational simplicity of traditional databases.

## Technical Overview

Rather than using a dedicated graph database (Neo4j, ArangoDB, etc.), AgentDock stores memory connections in relational tables and performs graph operations through a combination of SQL recursive CTEs and in-memory algorithms. This approach balances performance, reliability, and operational complexity.

## Why We Chose SQL Over Graph Databases: Technical Analysis

### 1. Scale Reality Check

**Agent Memory Characteristics:**
```
- Nodes per agent: 100-10,000 memories
- Edges per node: 2-10 connections average
- Graph diameter: 3-5 hops typical
- Cross-agent queries: None (isolated graphs)
- Update frequency: ~1-10 Hz per agent
```

**Conclusion**: These are tiny graphs by graph database standards. Facebook's social graph has billions of nodes with thousands of edges each. Our use case is 6-7 orders of magnitude smaller.

### 2. Query Pattern Analysis

**Our Actual Query Needs:**
- 90% queries: Direct connections (1 hop)
- 9% queries: 2-3 hop traversals
- 1% queries: Complex patterns
- 0% queries: Global graph algorithms

**SQL Performance for These Patterns:**
- 1 hop: Native JOIN - extremely fast
- 2-3 hops: Recursive CTE - still fast
- Complex: Load subgraph to memory - acceptable

### 3. Operational Cost-Benefit

**Graph Database Hidden Costs:**
- Separate infrastructure management
- Specialized backup/restore procedures
- Limited cloud provider support
- Requires graph query expertise
- Complex high availability setup
- Vendor lock-in concerns

**SQL Advantages We Leverage:**
- Runs on existing PostgreSQL/SQLite
- Standard backup/restore tools
- Available on all cloud providers
- SQL expertise is ubiquitous
- Built-in HA solutions
- No vendor lock-in

### 4. Feature Requirements Analysis

**What We Actually Need:**
- Store connections with metadata (type, strength, reason)
- Traverse relationships 1-3 levels deep
- Combine with vector similarity search
- Maintain ACID consistency
- Handle 100-10,000 memories per agent
- Support user-isolated graphs

**What We Don't Need:**
- Complex graph algorithms (PageRank, community detection)
- Massive parallel graph processing
- Cross-user graph traversal
- Real-time graph updates at scale
- Billions of nodes/edges
- Sub-millisecond traversal of deep graphs

## Architecture Components

### 1. Relational Storage Layer

Memory connections are persisted in standard relational tables:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    memories {
        uuid id PK
        text content
        vector embedding
        float importance
        timestamp created_at
    }
    
    memory_connections {
        uuid id PK
        uuid source_memory_id FK
        uuid target_memory_id FK
        enum connection_type
        float strength
        text reason
    }
    
    memories ||--o{ memory_connections : has_source
    memories ||--o{ memory_connections : has_target
```

**Actual SQL Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE memory_connections (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    source_memory_id UUID REFERENCES memories(id),
    target_memory_id UUID REFERENCES memories(id),
    connection_type ENUM('similar', 'related', 'causes', 'part_of', 'opposite'),
    strength FLOAT,        -- 0.0 to 1.0
    reason TEXT,          -- Why this connection exists
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Ensure unique connections
    UNIQUE(source_memory_id, target_memory_id),
    
    -- Indexes for fast lookups
    INDEX idx_source (source_memory_id, strength DESC),
    INDEX idx_target (target_memory_id, strength DESC)
);
```

### 2. SQL-Based Graph Traversal

For simple graph operations, we use SQL recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

**Direct Connection Query:**
```sql
-- Find direct connections (1 hop)
SELECT m.* FROM memories m
JOIN memory_connections mc ON m.id = mc.target_memory_id
WHERE mc.source_memory_id = :memory_id
  AND mc.strength > 0.5
ORDER BY mc.strength DESC;
```

**Multi-Hop Traversal:**
```sql
-- Find all memories connected within 3 hops
WITH RECURSIVE connected_memories AS (
    -- Base case: direct connections
    SELECT 
        target_memory_id as memory_id,
        1 as depth,
        strength
    FROM memory_connections 
    WHERE source_memory_id = :starting_memory_id
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: connections of connections
    SELECT 
        mc.target_memory_id,
        cm.depth + 1,
        cm.strength * mc.strength as combined_strength
    FROM memory_connections mc
    JOIN connected_memories cm ON mc.source_memory_id = cm.memory_id
    WHERE cm.depth < 3
)
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM connected_memories
ORDER BY combined_strength DESC;
```

**Alternative Multi-Hop Query (from original implementation):**
```sql
-- Multi-hop traversal using recursive CTE
WITH RECURSIVE connected AS (
    SELECT target_memory_id, strength, 1 as depth
    FROM memory_connections
    WHERE source_memory_id = :memory_id
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT mc.target_memory_id, c.strength * mc.strength, c.depth + 1
    FROM memory_connections mc
    JOIN connected c ON mc.source_memory_id = c.target_memory_id
    WHERE c.depth < 3
)
SELECT * FROM connected WHERE strength > 0.3;
```

### 3. In-Memory Graph Engine

For complex graph algorithms, we load relevant subgraphs into memory:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[SQL Database] -->|Load Subgraph| B[ConnectionGraph]
    B --> C[BFS Traversal]
    B --> D[Shortest Path]
    B --> E[Cluster Detection]
    B --> F[Centrality Analysis]
    
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**ConnectionGraph Implementation:**

```typescript
class ConnectionGraph {
    // Basic operations
    addNode(id: string, metadata: any): void
    addEdge(from: string, to: string, type: string, strength: number): void
    
    // Path finding
    findPath(from: string, to: string): string[]
    getConnectionPath(sourceId: string, targetId: string): string[]
    
    // Graph analysis
    detectCommunity(nodeId: string): Set<string>
    getMemoryClusters(minSize: number): string[][]
    
    // Centrality metrics
    calculateCentrality(nodeId: string): number
    getCentralMemories(limit: number): Array<{memoryId: string; centrality: number}>
    
    // NEW: Pattern analysis integration
    analyzeGraphPatterns(memoryId: string): MemoryConnection[]
}
```

This in-memory graph now actively enhances connection discovery through:
- **2-hop traversal**: Finding indirect relationships via `analyzeGraphPatterns()`
- **Community detection**: Identifying memory clusters with `detectCommunity()`
- **Centrality analysis**: Highlighting important memories using degree centrality
- **Path finding**: Discovering connection paths between any two memories

This in-memory graph is used when:
- Query depth exceeds 3 hops
- Complex pattern matching is required
- Graph algorithms (centrality, clustering) are needed
- Performance optimization for frequent queries

## Implementation Details

### Connection Discovery Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as New Memory
    participant E as Embedding Service
    participant DB as Database
    participant CG as ConnectionGraph
    
    M->>E: Generate embedding
    E-->>M: Vector representation
    M->>DB: Find similar memories (vector search)
    DB-->>M: Candidate memories
    M->>M: Apply semantic rules
    M->>DB: Store new connections
    M->>CG: Update in-memory graph (if loaded)
```

### Query Optimization Strategies

1. **Indexed Foreign Keys**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_connections_source 
     ON memory_connections(source_memory_id, strength DESC);
   CREATE INDEX idx_connections_target 
     ON memory_connections(target_memory_id, strength DESC);
   ```

2. **Materialized Paths** (for frequently accessed routes)
   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW memory_paths AS
   WITH RECURSIVE paths AS (...)
   SELECT * FROM paths;
   ```

3. **Connection Limits**
   - Maximum connections per memory: 50
   - Default traversal depth: 3
   - Similarity threshold: 0.7

## Best Practices

### 1. Connection Management
- Limit connections per memory to maintain performance
- Use connection strength to filter weak relationships
- Periodically prune low-value connections

### 2. Query Patterns
- Prefer shallow traversals (1-3 hops)
- Use in-memory graph for complex algorithms
- Cache frequently accessed subgraphs

### 3. Scaling Strategies
- Partition large graphs by user or time period
- Use read replicas for graph analysis
- Consider graph sampling for very large datasets
